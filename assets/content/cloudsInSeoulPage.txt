Clouds in Seoul is a singer-songwriter and cofounder of Bareulohsounds.

Other than a few years spent in the UK and on a US military base, he has lived in Seoul his whole life and wants to make music based on the observations he makes. He prefers an approach with as few instruments as possible, and hopes his music provides a personal listening experience.

He's helped co-produce a majority of Wuzy's releases, and is currently working on his debut album "Warmth".

His biggest musical influences are the Beatles, Trent Reznor, Rachael Yamagata, and the Lumineers.
