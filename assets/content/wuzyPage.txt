Wuzy (a.k.a wuzy.wav, producer tag "wuzy gettin' busy") is a producer, singer-songwriter, and cofounder of Bareulohsounds.

He started off with classical piano at the age of 5, and he had never thought about writing his own music till fifth grade when a friend of his (who now is a film director!) asked him to make a song for his movie.

Having lived half of his life in South Korea and the other half in the US, Wuzy draws a lot of his inspirations from his past experiences of adjusting to multiple different environments and past relationships by blending them into his genres such as Lo-fi, K-RnB, Bedroom Pop, and Ballad tracks.

Now based in North Carolina, Wuzy is working on his first full album where a bulk of the songs were written back when he was in the South Korean army.

His biggest musical influences are GSoul, Tori Kelly, Jacob Collier, Zion T, Jay Park, and Men I Trust.
