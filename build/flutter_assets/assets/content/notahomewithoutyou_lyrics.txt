You speak my tongue
I speak yours
You pay my debt
I pay yours

Isn't it strange?
How we came from different parts of the world
We'll put a blanket over our fort again

And we'll make it a home

It's not a home without you
It's not a home without you
I'm not at home without you

She makes it home when I'm away
